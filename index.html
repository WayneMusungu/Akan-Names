        <h1>Akan Naming System</h1>
        
        <p>The Akan people are handful of ethnic subgroups who live in regions of Ghana, Togo and Ivory Coast. In those countries, it is common for folks to have both an English/French name, which is often used in professional circles, and a traditional Akan name used with family. The Akan Naming is a popular naming tradition among the Ghana people just like Kenya how people are named according to the time, place and circumstance under which they were born. A child's Akan name is based on the circumstances of its birth/family, and the custom is most famous for its "day of the week" names. It is also believed that the day of the week the child is born on influences their personality, kind of like a horoscope. In fact, these names are known in Akan Twi as kradin, which translates to "soul name".</p>
