## Technologies Used

## Behaviour Driven Development

- The project is expected to collect data from the user through a form i.e the birthday.
- After taking the data, it is expected to calculate the specific day in which the user was born e.g sunday.
- Check if the user is a Male or Female.
- Give out a name according to the day on which the user was born.
- The formula for day calculation Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) -2CC-1) + ((5YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7
